# React Crash Course (TodoList)

Simple React-Todo list I wrote by following the instruction on this YouTube crash course on https://youtu.be/sBws8MSXN7A by Traversy Media.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```
